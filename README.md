Hello, this is Satya Rahul Jaladi. I am doing my masters degree in Automotive Engineering at Clemson University - International Centre for Automotive Research. I am passionate about Cars and tech in general. My career goal is work on designing and developing autonomous vehicles. 

This repository contains all the project work that I do related to autonomous vehicles. The code present here mostly focuses on robotics and automation.
