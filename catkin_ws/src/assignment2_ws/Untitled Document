I) Circle.py 

1) In this code the turtle follows a circular path based on the radius given by the input.
2) The value of the radius is given by the user. The turtle first moves a straight line until the lenght of the radius and then forms a circle
3) The code given is a combination of move.py and rotate.py
4) The code first uses move.py to move in the right direction for the given radius lenght 
5) Then turns 90 degrees to the left. The code for this is based on rotate.py
6) Next to form the circle a modified version of move.py is used to give the linear and angular velocity simultaneously to the turtle.
7) The value of the angular velocity is based on the formula V = RW


II) Square_openloop.py 

1) In this code the square forms a square based on the lenght of the side given by the user
2) The code is a combination of move.py and rotate.py
3) The turtle moves in a straight line and takes a 90 degree turn
4) The above logic is run 4 times in a 'for' loop to form a square
5) The linear speed and the angular speed are given as mentioned

III) Square_closedloop.py

1) The gotogoal.py code is modified to achieve the desired output
2) The code takes 5 points as inputs. The first and the last point should be given the same for the turtle to form a square
3) The points should be given in the following order (5,5) (8,5) (8,8) (5,8) (5,5) and the tolerance value should be given 0.1
4) Two separate proportional controllers are used here to control both the angular and linear speed of the turtle.
5) The first controlled gives the input to the angular velocity based on the difference between the current angle and goal angle
6) The second controller which controlles the linear speed gives the speed based on the distance between self and goal.
